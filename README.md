# Analysis of Conflict in Ethiopia

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file (**ethiopia_conflict_analysis.ipynb**) for the comprehensive analysis of political violence in Ethiopia. The project leverages the ACLED dataset, which provides detailed information on conflict events, including actors, event types, locations, and fatalities.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of political violence in Ethiopia by leveraging the ACLED dataset. The dataset contains detailed information on conflict events, including actors, event types, locations, and fatalities. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will uncover insights into the dynamics of political violence, patterns of actor interactions, and geographical trends within Ethiopia. By examining this data, we seek to better understand the nature and context of political conflicts in the region.
